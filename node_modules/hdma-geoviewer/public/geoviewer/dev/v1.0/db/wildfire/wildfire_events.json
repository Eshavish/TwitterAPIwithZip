Over the next few hours the wildfire intensified due to the strong Santa Ana winds driving it southwards. This prompted the evacuation of several schools (but not Del Norte), in addition to at least 20,000 homes. Within several hours, the fire covered at least 800 acres (320 ha) and was only 5% contained. The rapid southward spread of the fire caused mandatory evacuation orders to be issued for portions of 4S Ranch, Del Sur, Black Mountain Ranch, Rancho Santa Fe, and other residential communities. By 12:00 AM PDT on May 14, the portion of the fire within 4S Ranch and Del Sur had been completely extinguished, which was about 25% of the Bernardo Fire's 1,548 acre blaze. Later on May 14, all of the evacuation orders were lifted.[11]On Wednesday, May 14, at 6 PM PDT, the fire had burned 1,550 acres (630 ha) and was 50% contained.[12] By the next morning, it was reported as 75% contained and not expanding.[13] On May 16, the Bernardo Fire was reported to be 90% contained, but some structures were threatened by the fire.[14] On May 17, it was 95% contained, but the fire still didn't expand.[1] On May 17, at 8:14 PM PDT, it was reported that the Bernardo Fire was 100% contained.The San Diego Unified School District closed all its schools citywide on May 15, but reopened most of them on May 16.The cause of the Bernardo Fire has been ruled to be accidental; authorities said that it was ignited by sparks from faulty construction equipment</p><p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2014_San_Diego_County_wildfires' target='_blank'>Data Source: Wikipedia</a></p>",
